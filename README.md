This project focuses on designing and implementing a Redis-based database system to manage key-value data efficiently. The project utilizes Docker to ensure a portable and reproducible environment. A PHP-based website is developed to interact with the Redis database, allowing users to perform CRUD operations. Python scripts are used to efficiently populate Redis with data from external files. GitHub is used for version control, ensuring collaborative development. The outcome is a dynamic system capable of supporting efficient data storage and retrieval using Redisâ€™s in-memory database capabilities. A project report and a demo video will document the implementation process and findings, showcasing the practical skills developed during this project.
